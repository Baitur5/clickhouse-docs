# v24.6 Changelog for Cloud

Relevant changes for ClickHouse Cloud services based on the v24.5 release.

## Backward Incompatible Change

* Rework parallel processing in `Ordered` mode of storage `S3Queue`. This PR is backward incompatible for Ordered mode if you used settings `s3queue_processing_threads_num` or `s3queue_total_shards_num`. Setting `s3queue_total_shards_num` is deleted, previously it was allowed to use only under `s3queue_allow_experimental_sharded_mode`, which is now deprecated. A new setting is added - `s3queue_buckets`. [#64349](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/64349) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* New functions `snowflakeIDToDateTime`, `snowflakeIDToDateTime64`, `dateTimeToSnowflakeID`, and `dateTime64ToSnowflakeID` were added. Unlike the existing functions `snowflakeToDateTime`, `snowflakeToDateTime64`, `dateTimeToSnowflake`, and `dateTime64ToSnowflake`, the new functions are compatible with function `generateSnowflakeID`, i.e. they accept the snowflake IDs generated by `generateSnowflakeID` and produce snowflake IDs of the same type as `generateSnowflakeID` (i.e. `UInt64`). Furthermore, the new functions default to the UNIX epoch (aka. 1970-01-01), just like `generateSnowflakeID`. If necessary, a different epoch, e.g. Twitter's/X's epoch 2010-11-04 aka. 1288834974657 msec since UNIX epoch, can be passed. The old conversion functions are deprecated and will be removed after a transition period: to use them regardless, enable setting `allow_deprecated_snowflake_conversion_functions`. [#64948](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/64948) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).

## New Feature

* Introduced two additional columns in the `system.query_log`: `used_privileges` and `missing_privileges`. `used_privileges` is populated with the privileges that were checked during query execution, and `missing_privileges` contains required privileges that are missing. [#64597](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/64597) ([Alexey Katsman](https://github.com/alexkats)).

[#65144](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65144) ([Shaun Struwig](https://github.com/Blargian)).

## Performance Improvement

## Improvements

* `SHOW CREATE TABLE` executed on top of system tables will now show the super handy comment unique for each table which will explain why this table is needed. [#63788](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/63788) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* The second argument (scale) of functions `round()`, `roundBankers()`, `floor()`, `ceil()` and `trunc()` can now be non-const. [#64798](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/64798) ([Mikhail Gorshkov](https://github.com/mgorshkov)).
* Avoid possible deadlock during MergeTree index analysis when scheduling threads in a saturated service. [#59427](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59427) ([Sean Haynes](https://github.com/seandhaynes)).
* Several minor corner case fixes to S3 proxy support & tunneling. [#63427](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/63427) ([Arthur Passos](https://github.com/arthurpassos)).
* Add metrics to track the number of directories created and removed by the `plain_rewritable` metadata storage, and the number of entries in the local-to-remote in-memory map. [#64175](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/64175) ([Julia Kartseva](https://github.com/jkartseva)).
* The query cache now considers identical queries with different settings as different. This increases robustness in cases where different settings (e.g. `limit` or `additional_table_filters`) would affect the query result. [#64205](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/64205) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).

* Support the non standard error code `TotalQpsLimitExceeded` in object storage as a retryable error. [#64520](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/64520) ([Sema Checherinda](https://github.com/CheSema)).
* Updated Advanced Dashboard for both open-source and ClickHouse Cloud versions to include a chart for 'Maximum concurrent network connections'. [#64610](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/64610) ([Thom O'Connor](https://github.com/thomoco)).
* Improve progress report on `zeros_mt` and `generateRandom`. [#64804](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/64804) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Add an asynchronous metric `jemalloc.profile.active` to show whether sampling is currently active. This is an activation mechanism in addition to prof.active; both must be active for the calling thread to sample. [#64842](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/64842) ([Unalian](https://github.com/Unalian)).
* Remove mark of `allow_experimental_join_condition` as important. This mark may have prevented distributed queries in a mixed versions cluster from being executed successfully. [#65008](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65008) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Added server Asynchronous metrics `DiskGetObjectThrottler*` and `DiskGetObjectThrottler*` reflecting request per second rate limit defined with `s3_max_get_rps` and `s3_max_put_rps` disk settings and currently available number of requests that could be sent without hitting throttling limit on the disk. Metrics are defined for every disk that has a configured limit. [#65050](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65050) ([Sergei Trifonov](https://github.com/serxa)).
* Add a validation when creating a user with `bcrypt_hash`. [#65242](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65242) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Add profile events for number of rows read during/after `PREWHERE`. [#64198](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/64198) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Print query in `EXPLAIN PLAN` with parallel replicas. [#64298](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/64298) ([vdimir](https://github.com/vdimir)).
* Rename `allow_deprecated_functions` to `allow_deprecated_error_prone_window_functions`. [#64358](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/64358) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Respect `max_read_buffer_size` setting for file descriptors as well in the `file` table function. [#64532](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/64532) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Disable transactions for unsupported storages even for materialized views. [#64918](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/64918) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* Forbid `QUALIFY` clause in the old analyzer. The old analyzer ignored `QUALIFY`, so it could lead to unexpected data removal in mutations. [#65356](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65356) ([Dmitry Novik](https://github.com/novikd)).
