# ClickHouse Cloud

ClickHouse Cloud is the cloud offering created by the original creators of the popular open-source OLAP database ClickHouse. 
You can experience ClickHouse Cloud by [starting a free trial](https://clickhouse.cloud/signUp).

### ClickHouse Cloud benefits:

Some of the benefits of using ClickHouse Cloud are described below:

- **Fast time to value**: Start building instantly without having to size and scale your cluster.
- **Seamless scaling**: Automatic scaling adjusts to variable workloads so you don't have to over-provision for peak usage.
- **Serverless operations**: Sit back while we take care of sizing, scaling, security, reliability, and upgrades.
- **Transparent pricing**: Pay only for what you use, with resource reservations and scaling controls.
- **Total cost of ownership**: Best price / performance ratio and low administrative overhead.
- **Broad ecosystem**: Bring your favorite data connectors, visualization tools, SQL and language clients with you.

### What version of ClickHouse does ClickHouse Cloud use?

Clickhouse Cloud continuously upgrades your service to a newer version, but it won't be completely up to date with the latest OSS version as we do additional validation before rolling out new versions.
This validation usually takes 6-8 weeks.
The rollout of new versions is also phased by CSP, service type, and region.
We offer a "Fast Release Channel" for subscribing to updates ahead of the regular release schedule. Access to early upgrades is recommended only for non-production environments and can be requested by logging a support ticket.

If you want to simulate the behavior of an earlier version of ClickHouse, you can ask the ClickHouse Cloud support team to configure the compatibility setting for your service.
